=head1 NAME

OP::VimTag::Null - Empty base package for fake packages to aid tag generation

=head1 VERSION

version 1.110690

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use base 'OP::VimTag';
    my $gen = main->new;
    $gen->setup_fake_package('Foo::Bar');

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This empty package serves as the base class for fake packages that you don't
want to install - maybe they're needed only on another platform, on the
production system, need libraries that are impossible or difficult to install
etc.

You will probably not need to use this package directly. It is used when
calling C<setup_fake_package()> in L<OP::VimTag>.
