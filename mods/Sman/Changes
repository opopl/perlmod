1.03   Wed May 28 2008
        Look in /usr/local/lib/swish-e/perl and /usr/libexec/swish-e/perl/
            for SWISH::DefaultHighlight. Latter is where rpms put it.
        Better error outputs if we can't locate swish-e or load SWISH::API.
        No known machines use 'cat %F | gunzip -f --stdout | man -c' 
          to get ascii from manpages; method removed (it caused warnings on CentOS4).
        Added to and changed the TODO file.
        Enable (undocumented) ability to use doclifter as a manpage-to-xml converter.
        Added --scheme=[0|1] command line option to sman (default is 1, if the
          version of Swish-e installed supports it).
        Add support for fink on MacOSX.
        Support for debian 4.0 and later.
        Code cleanups and corrections; better error reporting.
